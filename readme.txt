**What is Hoverboard?**

Hoverboard is a system that creates a seamless way to add sibling premium add-on packs for free plugins.
It includes a code framework for developers that builds on the WordPress APIs and coding standards.
The framework enabled rapid plugin development for both free and premium plugins.
Making it easier to create premium add-on packs for free plugins means developers can start generating income.
Income means being able to spend more time crafting and creating.
More time crafting and creating means better plugins, better support, and more importantly longevity of the plugin.
